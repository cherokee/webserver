Cherokee Bundle: spawn-fcgi
---------------------------

This is a tool used to spawn FastCGI processes so that any FastCGI
application can be interfaced with Cherokee. This is, for example, how PHP is
supported in Cherokee, though in PHP's case you do not need any
knowledge of spawn-fcgi since it is configured by default.

It supports many parameters, but there is not much to be added to the
information about arguments supplied by the program.

This is the full information provided by the manpage.

             Filename of the FastCGI application to spawn

       -a <addr>::
             IP address to bind to (for TCP/IP-based IPC)

       -p <port>::
