Cookbook: Setting up Wordpress
------------------------------

Setting up link:http://wordpress.org/[Wordpress] with Cherokee is really
easy. We will assume that our `Document Root` directory is
`/var/www/wordpress` of the server we are working on. This recipe uses
Wordpress 2.6.3, which is the latest release at the time of writing.

You will need PHP support correctly configured in Cherokee, and PHP
with the MySQL module installed. The default configuration already
provides a valid PHP configuration for Cherokee if you have php-cgi
installed, but you can follow the appropriate recipe about
link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP] in case you don't have it
available for some reason.

Under these conditions, you could start Wordpress's installation and you
would already be able to have your site up and running.

However, we can add several refinements to Cherokee's setting. Mainly:

. Forward all requests for www.example.net (or whatever domain is resolved
  to our machine) to example.net

. Set up an appropriate url rewrite configuration for Wordpress, so
  you can enable permalinks.

. Serve directly as static content some specific file types and
  directories, avoiding any other file requests and eliminating this
  way any security risk related to vulnerable archives.

WARNING:
Beware of the long time it gets Wordpress to get through the
installation. It has been known to exceed the timeout that Cherokee
uses as default, and while this will still somwtimes allow for a
complete installation, it will most probably cause a failure while
delivering the last page of the process. Since this is the page that
provides the random password needed to access the admin page of
Wordpress, you installation will be useless.

If you encounter this problem, please increase your server's `timeout`
value, under the `Basic Behavior` paragraph of the `General` tab, and
start over.

If you are going to attempt to make an installation as is, with no
reconfiguration of Cherokee whatsoever, you can skip right to the
secction link:cookbook_wordpress.html#setting_up_wordpress[Setting up
Wordpress].

Setting up Cherokee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Default virtual server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We're assuming we have the default configuration initially provided by
Cherokee Admin.

We will begin by cloning the default virtual server, just to keep the
default PHP configuration. Create a clone named `example.net`.

Then, we'll delete every erasable rule in the default virtual server
since we are going to use it to redirect every petition not matched by
the example.net virtual server. We will set the remaining one to be
managed by the `Redirection` handler, like this:

[options="header"]
|===================================================
|Type     |Regular Expression |Redirection
|External |^(.*)$             |http://example.net/$1
|===================================================

After that, this is how the list of rules for this server should look
like.

This clears the first milestone. The remaining ones will be
accomplished by tweaking the `example.net` virtual server.


example.net
^^^^^^^^^^^

Remember to set up the `Document root` to `/var/www/wordpress`.

image::media/images/cookbook_wp_example1.png[WP example.net]

Delete all the rules except `php` and `Default`. We're heading right
to the second milestone now.

As previously, we will manage the `Default` rule with the redirection
handler.


[options="header"]
|=========================================
|Type     |Regular Expression |Redirection
|Internal |^/(.*)$            |/index.php
|=========================================

image::media/images/cookbook_wp_example2.png[WP example.net]

After this, most of the redirections will work. We'll set some more
rules to fine tune the rest of Wordpress' features. Those will be
`Directory` type rules for the following directories: `wp-includes`,
`wp-content` and `wp-admin`. These are to be managed with the `List &
Send` handler.

The third milestone, directly serving static files, is an easy task to
accomplish. This step is not required by Wordpress, but we will be
treating as static the contents of a couple of directories and the
sitemap files generated by our Google XML Sitemaps plugin of choice.

To do this, we will be creating `Directory` type rules for the
`images` and `static` directory, and a `Regular Expression` type rule
for the sitemap.

[options="header"]
|==================================
|Type               |Value
|Directory          |/images
|Directory          |/static
|Regular Expression |/sitemap.xml.*
|==================================

Remeber to manage them with a handler that can serve files: `Static
content` and `List & Send`.

Almost any evaluation order of your rules will suffice, as long as the
one that handles the PHP files is the first one. This is a valid one,
for instance.

Setting up Wordpress
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First download and uncompress the distributed Wordpress release into
`/var/www/wordpress`, and create a database suitable for the installation.

Log in to MySQL:

----------------
mysql -u root -p
----------------

And create the database for Wordpress. We will be using the name
'wp', the user 'wpuser' and the password 'wppassword', but
you should set up your own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE wp;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wp.* TO wpuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'wppassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wp.* TO wpuser@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'wppassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost` and follow the
instructions provided by the installer.

And the installation will be automatic. Just fill up the
requested values and you will obtain the following results once your
are through.

With that, you are done installing. Let's log in and make the last
adjustments.

Once we're logged, we can configure the way `permalinks` are
displayed. Just use the `Settings`->`Permalinks` menu, and adjust the
way the links are to be rewritten.

Remember to set up the plugins that are of interest for you, such as
the sitemaps generator, in a fashion compatible with what you
configured in Cherokee.

And voilà! You have a Wordpress installation working flawlessly with
Cherokee.
