-------------------

This command-line tool is the main Cherokee executable. It is used as
a safety net to invoke `cherokee-worker` and to ensure it is always
functioning. It also plays an important role in the
link:other_goodies.html#zero-downtime[zero-downtime] mechanism
implemented to allow graceful restarts of the server.

This is the full information provided by the manpage.
**********************************************************************
*NAME*::
       cherokee - Cherokee Web Server

*SYNOPSIS*::
       cherokee [options]

*DESCRIPTION*::
       `cherokee` is an extremely fast, flexible and embeddable web server.

*OPTIONS*::
       This command will launch the Cherokee webserver. It accepts the following options:

       -h, --help;;
               Prints a brief help message and terminates execution

       -V, --version;;
               Prints Cherokee's version and terminates execution

       -t, --test;;
               Perform a sanity check on the configuration file. The server will not run.

       -d, --detach;;
               Launches the server as a background process (default behaviour is to stay attached to the controlling terminal).

       -C<PATH>, --config=<PATH>;;
               Specifies an alternative path for the configuration file to use instead of the default cherokee.conf

       -p<PORT>, --port=<PORT>;;
               TCP port number to which the server will listen.

       -r<PATH>, --documentroot=<PATH>;;
               Launches a server exposing statically the specified directory. When launched with -r, the configuration file is ignored, and the Cherokee instance runs with its default values.

       -i, --print-server-info;;
               Print server technical information.

       -v, --valgrind;;
               Execute the worker process under Valgrind. Used only for development and troubleshooting purposes.


*SIGNALS*::
       The following signals are supported by Cherokee:

       SIGHUP;;  Restarts the server gracefully

       SIGUSR1;; Restarts the server closing all the opened connections

       SIGUSR2;; Reopens the log files

       SIGTERM;; Exits

*SEE ALSO*::
       Cherokee can be run either with this command or
       `cherokee-worker`.  This last option is discouraged if you are
       not developing though.  Note that, for most systems, a
       startup/shutdown script such as /etc/init.d/cherokee is
       provided and will probably be the most convenient invocation
       method.
