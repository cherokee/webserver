Other: Cherokee goodies
-----------------------

There are several important features of Cherokee that really do make a
difference in real-world production environments.

[[cherokee-admin]]
Cherokee-Admin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cherokee bundles a one of a kind GUI to set up every available feature
without the need of editing any configuration files by hand. It is a
modern and easy to manage web application that allows to set up the
server with speed and ease. The interface is thoroughly documented
throughout Cherokee's documentation. Several security measures prevent
non authorized personnel from accessing the application, and one-time
passwords are generated each time the program is launched. This can be
used to give temporary access to a remote administrator.

[[cherokee-tweak]]
Cherokee-Tweak
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The swiss-army knife of the Cherokee bundle. This little tool enables
you, among other things, to rotate the logs with absolutely no
downtime at all. No connections are lost. No delay happens. It can
also be used to trace Cherokee's state on the fly, even remotely and
on production servers.

This tool has its own documentation under the
link:bundle_cherokee-tweak.html[cherokee-tweak] section.

[[x-sendifle]]
X-Sendfile
~~~~~~~~~~
X-Sendfile is a special, non-standard HTTP header that has been
supported by Cherokee for a while. At first you might think it is no
big deal, but think again.It can be enabled in any CGI, FastCGI or
SCGI backend. Basicaly its job is to instruct the web server to ignore
the content of the response and replace it by whatever is specified in
the header. The main advantage of this is that it will be Cherokee the
one serving the file, making use of all its optimizations. It is
useful for processing script-output of e.g. php, perl, ruby or any
cgi.

This is particularly useful because it hands the load to Cherokee, all
the response headers from the backend are forwarded, the whole
application uses a lot less resources and performs several times
faster not having to worry about a task best suited for a web server.

You retain the ability to check for special privileges or dynamically
deciding anything contemplated by your backend's logic, you speed up
things a lot while having more resources freed, and you can even
specify the delivery of files outside of the web server's document
root path. Of course, this is to be done solely in controled
environments. In short, it offers a huge performance gain at
absolutely no cost.

Note that the X-Sendfile feature also supports `X-Accel-Redirect`
header, a similar feature offered by other web servers.
This is to allow the migration of applications supporting it whithout
having to make major code rewrites.

[[zero-downtime]]
Zero Downtime Updates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cherokee has an ability hardly ever seen in any service delivering
application, be it web content, multimedia streaming or almost any
other server you can think of.

Whenever a configuration change is applied, it is immediately
reflected in the web server with no downtime requirements to restart
the server. Of course the connections that are already being served
will continue normally with the same parameters that where negotiated
with the requesting clients, but they will not be shut down just to
perform a menial task such as restarting the server.

In fact, this mechanism is not only limited to configuration
updates. Cherokee is so smart that it can even apply this to perform
full program upgrades. This means you can completely replace the
binaries for new ones, launch the enhanced versions and yet not suffer
any downtime. Zero connection losses, no lag associated. Guaranteed.

This might seem as just another cool feature, but is in fact
huge. Just think about it: an extremely high traffic site cannot
afford to be down. Ever. Not to upgrade the webserver. Not to enhance
it. Not to reflect a new configuration setting. Thousands of hits per
second depend on it.

With Cherokee you can cope with this and much more. With Cherokee, it's
easier done than said.

[[ssl-vhosts]]
SSL Virtual Hosts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You might have been told elsewhere that named virtual hosts in SSL
cannot be supported without SNI (Server Name Indication) because a web
server cannot see the hostname header when the SSL request is being
processed. Technically this might have been correct in the past. The
first thing that the server has to do is to connect with the other end
by using SSL/TLS. The user entered host part of the URI must match the
Common Name (CN) provided by the certificate. Since virtual hosts are in
use, the CN of the first available certificate may or may not match
the one specified in the early stages of TLS negotiation.

////
However, nothing is forever.. and that applies to SSL/TLS connections
as well. Cherokee elegantly respins the SSL layer once it knows the
virtual server, and the magic occurs: SSL supporting several
certificates on the same IP address and port.
////

Cherokee supports the clean and standard method of dealing with this
issue called
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[Server Name
Indication] (SNI) that sends the name of the virtual host during the
TLS negotiation.

If link:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4366#section-3.1[SNI] is
supported by your SSL/TLS library, the SSL layer does not need to be
restarted. Since the host info can be put in the SSL handshake, things
will simply work as long as there is a web browser with SNI support at
the other side. Currently every modern web browser supports this, and
Cherokee has TLS SNI support for the OpenSSL backends.

Note that for SNI to work, client support is required. Web browsers
known to support it are Mozilla Firefox 2.0+, Opera 8.0+, Internet
Explorer 7 (Vista, not XP) or later and Google Chrome.

[[dbslayer]]
Database load balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Ever heard of the *DB Access Layer*, AKA
link:http://code.nytimes.com/projects/dbslayer/[DBSlayer]?

In case you haven't, DBSlayer is a database abstraction and pooling
layer designed to be simple to use (it's a DB abstraction layer for
the web age built on top of HTTP and JSON).

Well, Cherokee ships our very own
link:modules_handlers_dbslayer.html[DBSlayer] handler that provides
the fastest implementation in existence. It also provides several
interesting enhancements.

The usage of this balancing mechanism is a blessing when you wish to
scale connection growth against the database layer without replicating
your databases to every web server. It is also useful when you have
problems like local connections overwhelming a local slave, local
slave database failures, or replication failures.

This feature delivers connection pooling, database abstraction to
enable easier migrations and administration, load balancing and
automatic failover.

[[reverse_proxy]]
Reverse Proxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, that too! Cherokee also provides a state of the art
link:modules_handlers_proxy.html[HTTP reverse proxy] module. Check the
documentation for more details and give it a try.

And if that is not enough, you can always take a look at the rest of
the link:modules.html[modules] bundled with Cherokee.

[[streaming]]
Audio and video streaming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Both audio and video streaming are supported, intelligently handling
the available bandwidth to maximize service. Are you planning on being
the next Youtube? Take a look at the
link:modules_handlers_streaming.html[Streaming handler].

[[secure_downloads]]
Secure donwloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A pretty nifty feature that has been having great acceptance is
Cherokee's capability of generating temporal URLs to serve hidden
file. The link:modules_handlers_secdownload.html[Hidden Downloads]
handler is exactly what you need if, for instance, you plan on serving
lots of files and want to be protected against automatic download
scripts. Of course that is not the sole use of this. Cherokee only
implements the security. From there on, the sky is the limit.
