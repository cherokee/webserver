[[mailing_lists]]
Mailing Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The documentation for the latest stable release is always available at
the link:http://www.cherokee-project.com/doc[Cherokee Project] site.

If you cannot find what you are looking for in there, you can always
go to the official mailing lists. Post your questions there. Usually
the people hanging around will be happy to help.
Keep in mind that, as a sign of politeness towards the rest of the
readers, you should first check if the solution to your
problem is present in the archives. This will prevent duplicated
entries and will probably give you an answer a lot faster.

These are the lists currently in existence:

- link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cherokee-http[General list]
- link:https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cherokee-http-dev[Development list]
