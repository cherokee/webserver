Upgrading Cherokee
------------------

The current mechanism of choice to configure Cherokee did not exist
prior to release 0.6. A lot has happened since then, and Cherokee has
been constantly improving in terms of stability, efficiency and
features.

If you happen to be running an old version of Cherokee and would like
to keep your current configuration settings, you can upgrade your
cherokee.conf file through the Python scripts provided under
`contrib`.

The usage is quite simple, and works the same way for all the
scripts:

----
    cp /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf-0.99.9
    contrib/0999to09910.py /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf-0.99.9 /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf
----

If you need to upgrade from a really old release, simply apply the
whole chain of conversions.

Note that some of the available prepackaged versions of Cherokee
are set to offer the possibillity of automatically running these scripts
to upgrade the configuration if files from a prior release are detected
in the system.

Every effort is made to bulletproof the upgrade scripts. If any of
them does not work for you, do not hesitate to send a bug report.
However, Cherokee is a very active project and has been steadily
advancing and incorporating technical improvements. You should really be
using link:bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin] to configure your
system if you want to take full advantage of the new features. Even if
the upgrade process is successful, you should use the new configuration
file as a start point and go through the normal configuration process
using link:bundle_cherokee-admin.html[cherokee-admin].
