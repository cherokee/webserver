Cookbook: Redirections
----------------------

Every now and then a redirection example is requested in the
link:other_community.html[mailing list]. This recipe is meant to be a
central archive of such examples. Remember there are some more generic
examples both in the link:config_walkthrough.html[quickstart] and in
the link:modules_handlers_redir.html[redirection] handler sections.

There is also a wizard to automatically assist you with
redirections. It can be found in the link:config_wizards.html[Wizards]
section of the `Virtual Servers` panel.

Redirecting www.example.net to example.net
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes a site will have several domains or subdomains pointing to
the same official name. For whatever reasons (site statistics, for
instance), having many subdomains redirected to a unique subdomain
might be desirable. This can be accomplished fairly easily. The
general recipe consists in defining a virtual host with the sole
purpose of redirecting petitions to the official subdomain. In our
example, this could manage __*.example.net__ and the __.com__ and
__.org__ variations.

The official name would then be managed by another virtual host
(just for __example.net__). The `redir` virtual host will have a
`Default` managed by the `Redirection` handler.

This in turn would define an _external redirection_ with a _Regular
Expression_ like __^/(.*)$__ and the appropriate _Substitution_:
http://example.net/$1

Keep in mind the redirection has to be external in order for Cherokee
to rewrite the the URL. If it wasn't, the redirection would be applied
but no change would be displayed to the users while browsing the site.


Redirecting to HTTPS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now lets imagine a scenario where the name of the virtual server
matched is of importance for the substitution.  For instance, supose
you want all the traffic to the `/secure_dir` directory of a regular
HTTP channel to be redirected to an HTTPS channel through a server
whose name depends on that of the matching host.

In this case you need to resort to the macros supported by the
handler. First you'll have to create a `Directory` type rule managed
by the `Redirection` handler.  And second, define an _external
redirection_ with a _Regular Expression_ like __^/(.*)$__ and the
appropriate _Substitution_: https://${host}/secure_dir/$1
