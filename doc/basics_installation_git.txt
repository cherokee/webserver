Installation from Github
------------------------

The latest, bleeding edge Cherokee release can always be retrieved via
Git. Note that this is the development release and could very well be
unstable. In general it is not recommended to run this release in
production environments.

Briefly, Git is a system tool used to store and maintain files and a
history of their changes over time, and it is an invaluable development
tool. The Cherokee source code and related files are kept in a Git repository
at github.com/cherokee/webserver.git.

To download the Git repository you will need a special piece of
software called a Git client.

[[checkout]]
Checking out the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To check out the sources for the first time from the repository, use this command:

----
git clone git://github.com/cherokee/webserver cherokee
----

[[update]]
Updating the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update your sources every day, you use this command:

----
git pull
----


[[compile]]
Compiling and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have downloaded the latest Git revision, you will need to
follow the installation instructions for your specific platform.

Note that some of the files present in the tarball are not present in the
Git repository. Most noticeably, the file `./configure` that will be needed 
for the installation process.

To generate the missing files simply run this command:

----
./autogen.sh
----

As optional parameters, you can specify any option you want passed
to `./configure`. This way you can avoid issuing another command for
the configuration.

For instance, this line will configure your local copy with the four
specified parameters:

----
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr        --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --localstatedir=/var --enable-trace
----

You would then be ready to proceed with the standard compilation
process for your platform:
