Installation from GitHub
------------------------

The latest, bleeding edge Cherokee release can always be retrieved via
Git. Note that this is the development release and could very well be
unstable. In general it is not recommended to run this release in
production environments.

Briefly, Git is a system tool used to store and maintain files and a
history of their changes over time, and it is an invaluable development
tool. The Cherokee source code and related files are kept in a Git repository
on link:https://github.com/cherokee/webserver[GitHub].

You can read more about Git at link:http://git-scm.com/[git-scm.com].

To download the Git repository you will need a special piece of
software called a Git client. On a Linux-based system, the official 
command-line client, simply named ``git``, can typically be installed
from repositories.  For instance, on an Ubuntu or Debian-based system
install using:

----
sudo apt-get install git
----

or on a Yum-based system, such as Fedora, RHEL or CentOS install using:

----
sudo yum install git-core
----


[[clone]]
Cloning the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To take a copy of the sources for the first time from the repository, use this
command:

----
git clone --recursive git://github.com/cherokee/webserver cherokee
----

If you are on a system with a version of Git earlier than 1.6.5, then you
will also need to manually update the Git submodules for this repository:

----
git clone git://github.com/cherokee/webserver cherokee
cd cherokee
git submodule update --init
----
 

[[update]]
Updating the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To update the source with latest changes, you use this command within your
local repository:

----
git pull -u
----


[[compile]]
Compiling and installing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have downloaded the latest source from Git, you will need to
follow the installation instructions for your specific platform.

Note that some of the files present in a release tarball are not present in
Git - the most notable of which is the `./configure` file that will be needed
for the compilation and installation process.

To generate the missing files simply run this command within your local
repository:

----
./autogen.sh
----

As optional parameters, you can specify any option you want passed
to `./configure`. This way you can avoid issuing another command for
the configuration.

For instance, this line will configure your local copy with the four
specified parameters:

----
./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr        --sysconfdir=/etc \
             --localstatedir=/var --enable-trace
----

Once you have done this, you are now ready to proceed with the standard
compilation process for your platform:
