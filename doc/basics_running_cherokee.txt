Running Cherokee
----------------

There are several ways you can run Cherokee:

. Automatic start: this makes use of the mechanism offered by your OS
  that should have been configured when Cherokee was installed. It
  will run making use of the link:dev_cherokee.conf.html[`cherokee.conf`]
  present in your system.

. Guardian wrapper: The link:other_bundle_cherokee.html[cherokee] program
  comes as a standard part of the Cherokee bundle. It is a security
  mechanism that ensures Cherokee's recovery in case of any system
  failure and wraps the calls to `cherokee-worker`. This is what is
  actually launched when Cherokee is automatically started.

. Stand alone instance: Cherokee supports a series of parameters to
  launch it from the command line. Refer to the the appropriate
  documentation section about
  link:other_bundle_cherokee-worker.html[`cherokee-worker`] to see the
  complete list of optional arguments.

. Cherokee-Admin: The administration web interface allows you to
  configure and launch Cherokee. This is probably where you want to
  start if you have just installed the web server. Launch the
  link:other_bundle_cherokee-admin.html[`cherokee-admin`] process and follow
  the link:config_walkthrough.html[Quickstart] section of the
  documentation.
