Cookbook: Setting up Moodle
---------------------------

Running link:http://moodle.org/[Moodle] on Cherokee is easy to
do. Since Moodle has relatively high requirements (1GB RAM is
recommended), it is actually a very good idea to run a high
performance web server and see how things simply start flying.

The only software requirements are a web server, MySQL and PHP with
several extensions. You can see the complete list of
link:http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_Moodle#Software[software
requirements] at Moodle's site. Don't worry about this point. The
installer will detail exactly what are the missing modules, soy you
can install whatever you need during that part of the process.

Cherokee can be configured in a breeze thanks to the provided Moodle
Wizard.

[[wizard_configuration]]
Configure Cherokee using the Wizard
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[cherokee_vserver]]
Setting up Moodle as a new Virtual Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step would be to go to the virtual server list page. Then,
click on the `Add` button at the top of the panel to show the list of
available wizards.

Then, select the `Misc` category, run the Moodle wizard and you are
good to go.

Feel free to manually tune whatever
parameters you see fit, but no more intervention is needed.

[[cherokee_dir]]
Setting up Moodle inside a Directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Moodle can also be configured inside a directory. Let's suppose we
want to set up Moodle inside the `/course` directory of one of our
virtual servers.

In this case, the first thing you will have to do is to enter the
virtual server configuration you'd like to configure Moodle in. Once
in there, click on the rule addition button and choose the `Moodle`
wizard.

As in the previous case, this wizard will ask some very basic
information, including the public web directory where Moodle will be
set up and the local Moodle source directory.


[[moodle]]
Setting up Moodle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Of course, you will need to download Moodle from the
link:http://download.moodle.org/[download site] if you don't already
have a copy.

For this example we will be using
link:http://download.moodle.org/download.php/stable19/moodle-weekly-19.tgz[moodle-weekly-19],
which is the recommended option at the time of writing.

Uncompress it to a directory of your choice, like `/var/www/moodle`,
and remember changing ownership to that of the user under which
Cherokee will be running.

First download and uncompress the distributed Moodle release into
`/var/www/moodle`, and create a database suitable for the installation.

Log in to MySQL:

----------------
mysql -u root -p
----------------

And create the database for Moodle. We will be using the name
'moodle', the user 'moodleuser' and the password 'moodlepassword', but
you should set up your own.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE DATABASE moodle DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO moodleuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'moodlepassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON moodle.* TO moodleuser@localhost.localdomain IDENTIFIED BY 'moodlepassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
quit;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

You will also have to create a directory for Moodle to save data in
it. It must be outside the web document tree.

-------------------------------------
mkdir /var/www/moodledata
chmod 0770 moodledata
chown www-data:www-data moodledata
-------------------------------------

Then point your web browser to `http://localhost` and follow the
instructions provided by the installer. You will only need to provide
the above mentioned database information and very little else.

.Installation paths

.Database settings
image::media/images/cookbook_moodle_db.png[Database settings]

As mentioned before, checks will be performed to see if the needed PHP
modules are available. Make sure to have the ones you'll be needing.

.PHP requirements
image::media/images/cookbook_moodle_modules.png[PHP modules]

This will get you through the whole installation process in around 20
little extra steps give or take. Just click on `continue` and you
should be fine. It will populate your database and get you through the
whole installation process.

.Moodle in action

Once you are done, don't forget to set up your
link:http://docs.moodle.org/en/Cron[cron tasks] and configure the
link:http://docs.moodle.org/en/Backup_settings[backup settings]. You
can find all the information to create new courses and everything else
there is to know in link:http://docs.moodle.org/[Moodle's
documentation].


[[manual_configuration]]
Setting up Cherokee manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the wizard is the recommended option to set up Moodle on
Cherokee. However, should you wish to do it manually you will just
need PHP support correctly configured in Cherokee. Please refer to the
PHP Wizard or to the pertaining documentation section about
link:cookbook_php.html[setting up PHP] in case you don't have it
available for some reason.

Besides the PHP requirement, nothing else is needed.

Simply set the `Document root` to `/var/www/moodle` and you are ready
to go. This is done within the `Basics` tab of the chosen `Virtual
Server`.
