-------------------------

This is the administration interface that allows for hassle-free,
simple and easy configuration of the Cherokee web server. It is the
only administration mechanism that should be to such task and is in
fact the only recommended option.

If you want to access the administration interface from the same
computer that you installed cherokee on, simply start the
administration interface by running:


----
cherokee-admin
----

You will obtain an output similar to the following one, which provides
the information needed to be able to access the configuration
interface. This information is generated randomly each time the
program is launche, and it can be very useful in case you need to to
give temporary access to a remote administrator in the confidence that
no future accesses will be possible.

----
Login:
  User:              admin
  One-time Password: F4c7cyogxhTGbp1r

Cherokee Web Server 1.0.0b5077 (May 12 2010): Listening on port ALL:80, TLS
disabled, IPv6 enabled, using epoll, 1024 fds system limit, max. 505
connections, caching I/O, 10 threads, 50 connections per thread, standard
scheduling policy
----

Then redirect your web browser to 127.0.0.1:9090, which is the default
address and port for the administration interface. The _User_ and
_One-time Password_ will be required initially. This is to prevent
other users of the local host from being able to configure the server
unless they have access to the password.

If you want to access the administration interface from another
computer, the easiest solution is to bind the cherokee administration
interface to all network interfaces:

----
cherokee-admin -b
----

WARNING: By starting cherokee-admin listening on all interfaces,
everyone that can access the computer and has the password can alter
your cherokee configuration. Don't use this in a production
environment! It is much better to use 'ssh -L' in these cases.

Instead of binding it to every interface, we encourage you to use an
SSH tunnel. This is the recommended way. In order to do so you must
issue the following command:

----
ssh -L 9090:localhost:9090 remote_IP
----

After that you can access the remote interface through
http://localhost:9090 and every request will be forwarded to the
remote IP running cherokee-admin.

Of course these options can be combined to your heart's contempt.

.Example:
Make cherokee use a different configuration file, listen on port 9091
and grab the administration interface application from a different
path:

----
cherokee-admin -b -p 9091 -C /etc/cherokee/cherokee2.conf \
                 -d /path/to/git_master/cherokee-admin/
----

This is the full information provided by the manpage.
**********************************************************************
*NAME*::
       `cherokee-admin` - Runs Cherokeeâ€™s administrative interface

*SYNOPSIS*::
       `cherokee-admin` [-d DIR] [-p PORT] [-C FILE] [-b] [-x] [-u] [-t]

*DESCRIPTION*::
       `cherokee-admin` runs the server for the administrative interface used to
       configure Cherokee. The interface itself will be available via your Web
       browser.

*OPTIONS*::
       `cherokee-admin` accepts the following options:

       -h, --help;;
               Shows brief usage information

       -V, --version;;
               Show version and exit

       -x, --debug;;

               Print the backend errors to the terminal where it is executing.
               If omited, this debug information is lost.

       -u, --unsecure;;
               Allows accessing cherokee-admin's interface without
               requiring the user to authenticate. This disables a
               security measure and is only meant to ease the
               development process. The usage of this parameter is
               strongly discouraged for regular users.

       -b[<IP>], --bind[=<IP>];;
               By  default `cherokee-admin` binds only to 127.0.0.1 (localhost),
               which means you can only connect to it from  the  same  system.
               With this parameter you can specify the network address
               to listen to. If no IP is provided, it will bind to all
               interfaces.


       -d<DIR>, --appdir=<DIR>;;
               Uses a custom admin-interface path where the source
               files of cherokee-admin reside.

       -p<NUM>, --port=<NUM>;;
               Specifies an alternative port. By default, 9090.

       -t, --internal-unix;;
               By default, cherokee-admin uses TCP for internal
               communications. This parameter specifies that a Unix
               domain socket should be used instead. The default
               behavior is the safest one, so this parameter should
               rarely by used.

       -T<NUM>, --thread=<NUM>;;
               Specify the number of threads that the program should
               use. Useful for memory/power constrained machines.


       -C<PATH>, --target=PATH;;
               Requests  a  configuration  file  different  than  the  default
               /etc/cherokee/cherokee.conf to be used
