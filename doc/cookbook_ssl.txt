Cookbook: SSL, TLS and certificates
-----------------------------------

This section answers some general questions and details the procedure
to generate SSL keys.

[[general]]
General questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Can the same server provide HTTP and HTTPS?

Yes. HTTP and HTTPS use different server ports. The former binds to
port 80 and the latter to port 443, so there is no conflict between
them. To provide HTTPS you will need matching certificates.

Keep in mind that to have one of your virtual servers with HTTPS
enabled you will need to configure HTTPS settings for all of them.

.Which port does HTTPS use?

HTTPS can run on any port, but the standards specify port 443. That's
where any HTTPS compliant browser will look by default. You can change
that by specifying another port in the URL. For example,
https://example.com:8080/ would look for an HTTPS server on port 8080.

.Can one host handle HTTPS requests for multiple virtual servers?

Yes, it can. This is a common question because a web server cannot see
the hostname header when the HTTPS request is being processed. The
user entered host part of the URI must match the Common Name (CN)
provided by the certificate. Since virtual hosts are in use, the CN of
the first available certificate may or may not match the one specified
in the early stages of TLS negotiation.

Fortunately this can be overcomed by using SNI (Server Name
Indication), which places the host information in the SSL
handshake. If the web server is accessed through a web browser that
supports SNI, things will just work. Every modern web browser does.

For legacy scenarios where using SNI if not possible, there is a
workaround detailed in the next question.

[[workaround]]
.Are there workarounds when SNI can't be used?

Using SNI is the clean and standard way to go. For legacy scenarios
where using SNI is not and option, Cherokee supports a workaround.
The mechanism requires the web server to listen to several IPs, and to
assign a specific one for each virtual server. This can be done
through the `Match` tab of the virtual server configuration, by
assigning an IP-method to the desired IP. Remember that the list of
virtual servers is evaluated from top to bottom, so in case you
specify the same IP for several virtual servers, only the first one
will actually match. In case you need more flexibility than that to
match your domains, you can always add more than one matching criteria
on that section. An IP/Subnet match plus a simultaneous wildcard match
is a combination likely to cover every corner-case scenario you are
presented with.

.How to enable the SSL support?

SSL support is not enabled by default. You will have to perform three
straightforward actions is order to enable it:

  . The first step is to enable a TLS/SSL engine. The option is
    located in the link:config_general.html[General] configuration
    setting. Cherokee is shipped with a libssl plug-in.

  . Once the engine is configured, a new
    link:config_general.html#ports_to_listen[binding port] must be
    configured.  By default, HTTPS uses the port 443. Remember to add
    this port, and to check the TLS toggle button.

  . The last step would be to assign SSL certificates to the virtual
    servers, starting with the default virtual server.  Cherokee uses
    SNI to distinguish between virtual servers. The certificate
    specified in the default server will be used in the first
    negotiation. If not present, the startup sequence will fail. The
    configuration is found inside each
    link:config_virtual_servers.html#security[virtual server]
    configuration, under the Security tab. This part is _very
    important_: you have to concatenate your certificates into a
    single file in order to use them in Cherokee.

.How to manually test HTTP/HTTPS?

HTTP can easily be tested like this:
----
$ telnet localhost 80
 GET / HTTP/1.0
----

For HTTPS it is not so easy because of the SSL protocol between TCP
and HTTP. However you can do a similar check with the help of
OpenSSL's s_client command.

----
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:443 -state -debug
 GET / HTTP/1.0
----

You will receive detailed information about the SSL handshake before
the actual HTTP response.

A more general command line client is probably a better choice.
link:http://curl.haxx.se/[cURL] deals with both HTTP and HTTPS, and
performs a bunch of other interesting stuff.

----
$ curl http://localhost/
$ curl https://localhost/

[[overview]]
Private keys and Certificates overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First some terminology:

. RSA private key file: a digital file that can be used to decrypt
  messages sent to you. It has a public component that must be
  distributed (via your Certificate file) to allow people to encrypt
  those messages.

. CSR, or Certificate Signing Request: a digital file containing your
  public key and your name. It is sent to a Certifying Authority (CA)
  that will convert sign it to convert it into a real Certificate.

. Certificate: contains your RSA public key and name, the name of the
  CA, and is digitally signed by the CA. A browser that knows the CA
  can verify the signature and obtain your RSA public key, which can
  be used to send messages which only you can decrypt.

.Does the startup between a non-SSL and an SSL-aware web server differ?

Yes. Although in essence it is exactly the same, if you have a
passphrase on your SSL private key file, a startup dialog will asks
you to enter it. This can be problematic if the web server needs to be
started automatically. In this case, the link:#passphrase[passphrase]
can be removed from your private key at the cost of erasing a security
layer, which brings additional security risks.

.Does Cherokee offer any help for Certificate Generation?

Yes. A script is provided to assist you with Certificate Generation.

Just locate the `contrib` subdirectory and type:

----
make-cert.sh
----

And follow the instructions. It will generate the required files, but
you will have to install them manually.

It has been tested and has worked fine every time, but if you don't find
the script or it doesn't work for you can always follow the rest of
the procedure described in this recipe to manually generate the
certificates.


[[locate]]
Locate CA.pl or CA.sh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* On Debian or Ubuntu those are usually located under /usr/lib/ssl/misc/
* On MacOS X, you will find them in /System/Library/OpenSSL/misc/

In any other case ``find / -iname CA.pl -print`` will help you to locate it.

----

[[self_sign]]
Self signed certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is another way to generate certificate files. Ramon Pons sent this
little script to create self signed certificates::

----
#!/bin/sh
CERTNAME=cherokee.pem
openssl req -days 1000 -new -x509 -nodes -out $CERTNAME -keyout $CERTNAME
chmod 600 $CERTNAME
openssl verify $CERTNAME
if [ $? != 0 ]; then
    \mv $CERTNAME $CERTNAME.not_valid
fi
----

You can see that, in essence, it issues the following command:
----
$ openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
----

Which would produce a couple of files: the SSL Certificate File
(server.crt) and the SSL Certificate key file (server.key).

This server.key does not have any passphrase. To add a passphrase to
the key, you should run the following command, and enter & verify the
passphrase as requested.

----
$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new
$ mv server.key.new server.key
----

You should probably backup the key file and the entered passphrase in
a secure location.


[[passphrase]]
Pass-phrase issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As noted above, if you have a pass-phrase on your SSL private key file,
the web-server start up will remain on hold until you enter it. Here
is the information needed to change it or even remove it, but bare in
mind the security implications.

.How to change the pass-phrase on a private key file?

Simply read it with the old pass-phrase and write it again, specifying
a new pass-phrase.  This can be done withe these commands:

----
$ openssl rsa -des3 -in server.key -out server.key.new
$ mv server.key.new server.key
----


.How to get rid of the pass-phrase?

The RSA private key inside the server.key file is stored in encrypted
format for security reasons. The pass-phrase is needed to decrypt this
file, so it can be read and parsed. Thus, removing it removes a layer
of security from the web server. It is advised to keep a backup copy
of the original file before proceeding.

----
 $ cp server.key server.key.org
 $ openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
 $ chmod 400 server.key
----

Since the server.key now contains an unencrypted copy of the key, if
anyone gets it they will be able to impersonate you on the net.

[[verification]]
Verifying that a private key matches its Certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To view the Certificate and the key run the commands:
----
$ openssl x509 -noout -text -in server.crt
$ openssl rsa  -noout -text -in server.key
----

The `modulus` and the `public exponent` portions in the key and the
Certificate must match. It is difficult to visually check that the
long modulus numbers are the same, so this approach can be used
instead to obtain the numbers to compare (though it is mathematically
less rigorous).

----
$ openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in server.crt | openssl md5
$ openssl  rsa -noout -modulus -in server.key | openssl md5
----

To check to which key or certificate a particular CSR belongs you can
perform the same calculation on the CSR as follows:

----
$ openssl req -noout -modulus -in server.csr | openssl md5
----
