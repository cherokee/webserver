Installation on Unix
--------------------

If you have a prepackaged version of Cherokee available in your
Unix/Linux favorite variant, please use the provided installation
mechanism of choice. This will provide you with automatic bootup
scripts, consistency and dependency checks, and an easy upgrade path
tailored to your system whenever a new package is available.

Skip through to the link:#APT[APT] section of this document if you are using Debian or Ubuntu.

If you do not find a prepackaged version that suits your needs, you
can always download and compile your own.

Advanced parameters

If you want to learn more about 'configure' you can run `./configure
--help`. The list of parameter is extensive, so you might want to take
a look at it, particularly if you are a developer. Some of the most
used parameters are these:

[cols="43%,57%",options="header"]

[[autostart]]
Autostart
~~~~~~~~~

If you need the cherokee webserver to start at boot (through init's
runlevel) you can find a start/stop script in the contrib source
directory:

-----------------------------------------
cp contrib/cherokee /etc/init.d/
-----------------------------------------

Additionally, you need to create symlinks at the correct rc directory
of the appropriate runlevel. This can be done in many ways and usually
each distribution offers its own tools to do so.



[[APT]]
APT
~~~

This section is intended for those who use Debian and Ubuntu and want
to use the latest -and greatest- version of Cherokee when it is not
yet available on the APT repositories. You can do several things
besides installing manually.

For Ubuntu users, simply use the PPA repository. Normally when a new
Cherokee version is released, the repositories will be swiftly
updated. Simply type:

----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cherokee-webserver
----

That will add the PPA keys. You just need to sudo apt-get update
afterwards.

Please note that there are two Launchpad Cherokee repositories: the
link:https://edge.launchpad.net/~cherokee-webserver/+archive/ppa/+packages[current]
(stable) repository and the new repository called
link:https://edge.launchpad.net/~cherokee-webserver/+archive/i-tse[i-tse]
('new' in Cherokee language).

Everytime a new cherokee version is released it goes straight to the
the i-tse repository. If no critical bugs are found or no new version
is released within 8 days, this version is then moved moved to the
current PPA. It is also pushed to Debian Unstable.

Doing this ensures that production servers using the current version
get a tested version every time they upgrade.

If you want to use the i-tse ( NEW ) version just add the new repository:

.Ubuntu Lucid
----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cherokee-webserver/i-tse
----

.Karmic, Jaunty, Hardy: add this to your sources.list
----
deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/cherokee-webserver/i-tse/ubuntu YOURVERSION main
----

For Debian users, you will have to use packages from 'Unstable' or
'Testing' if you want to keep up.

Cherokee does not have deep dependencies, so apt-pinning might be
enough for you.

The APT suite can handle more than one set of packages with
different priorities. If you want to get the latest Cherokee off
unstable, you can make your /etc/apt/sources.list be:

------------------------------------------------------------
 deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ lenny main
 deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ lenny main

 deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sid main
 deb-src http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ sid main
------------------------------------------------------------

And set your preferences to lenny in /etc/apt/preferences:

------------------------------------------------------------
 Package: *
 Pin: release a=stable
 Pin-priority: 900

 Package: *
 Pin: release a=testing
 Pin-priority: 200
------------------------------------------------------------

Just make the pin-priority lower. Then, `aptitude update` to get the
full lists, and install Cherokee from unstable:

----
# aptitude -t testing install cherokee
----

This will probably pull newer versions of libssl-dev, libssl0.9.8 and
mysql-common to fulfill dependencies. Of course, this _might_ break
other packages depending on those specific versions, but it is not
very likely.


[[debian_from_source]]
Debian package from source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PPA and Unstable repositories keep up to date with the latest Cherokee
releases. Usually the time lapse between releasing a new version and
having the repositories updated is really short.

However, in the event that they arent, some options remain if you want
to enjoy the latest Cherokee enhancements. Besides building directly
from our GIT repository, you can build from source for
Debian/Ubuntu. You will be able to build it cleanly in a `.deb`
package with dependencies, and push the new release as fast as
possible to production.

The process is very straight forward. As with any Debian package, it
should be enough just to download the source package, get its
build-dependencies, and build.

----
$ apt-get source cherokee
(...)
$ sudo apt-get build-dep cherokee
(...)
$ cd cherokee-*     # depending on your version
$ debuild
----

Of course, if you want to contribute to Debian/Ubuntu packaging, it is
a _bit_ more involved.

You should instead clone the Git repository at
link:git://git.debian.org/collab-maint/cherokee.git[git://git.debian.org/collab-maint/cherokee.git]

After that, the process for building is very similar. You only need to
get Cherokee's official sources, which can be done running the
following command within the Cherokee tree:

----
$ uscan --force
----

And build using git-buildpackage:

----
$ git-buildpackage
----

That's it.
