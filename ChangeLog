	* pyscgi.py (SCGIHandler.handle_request): The default handler
	method had to use send() so reply the requests rather than the low
	level self.wfile socket.

	* Applies a couple of changes that there released with 1.7 but
	that for some reason were not committed.

2008-03-23  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py: Added a new method send() to write the
	information safely. There was an issue on OS X that made large
	responses to fail.

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py: Print all the exceptions except of SystemExit.

2007-12-29  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py: Fixed communication issue between the SCGI
	application and the web server. The information follow could
	fail because EAGAIN errors. It is fixed now.

	* The __init__.py file inside the pyscgi module is empty, this
	means that to import the module properly I need to type: 
	from pyscgi.pyscgi import *, instead of: from pyscgi import *
	Patch by Alberto Ruiz <aruiz@gnome.org>

2007-08-02  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* tests/test1_env.py, tests/test2_post.py: Updated to use rfile
	and wfile instead of input and output.

2007-02-07  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py (SCGIHandler.__init__): It inherits from
	StreamRequestHandler rather than from BaseRequestHandler.

2007-01-27  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>

	* pyscgi/pyscgi.py (SCGIHandler.handle): self.handle_request() is
	now inside a try clause. That method have to be implement by the
	user, so there is a change of something going wrong, in which case
	the server should close the in/out descriptiors as well.

2006-12-12  Alvaro Lopez Ortega  <alvaro@alobbs.com>
