<h2>Networking</h2>

<p class="help_p">This sections allows you to configure how the
server interacts with the network.</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>IPv6</b> enables the IPv6 support. If it is
unselected the server will not use IPv6 even if the operating system
supports it.</p>

<p class="help_p"><b>Listen</b>: IP Address to which the server will
bind itself while waiting for incoming requests.
This is useful if the computer has more than one IP address
and you want to start one server per IP address.<br>
<b>NOTE</b>If you don't specify any IP address,
than the server will listen to all configured IP addresses.
</p>

<h2>Basic Behaviour</h2>
<p class="help_p"><b>KeepAlive</b>: enables the global keep alive
support for the client requests. It increases the client performance
by reusing a connection for more than one request.
It is usually a good idea leave it on, unless you end up in trillions
of concurrent connections (i.e. more than 30000 - 40000).
</p>

<h2>Server Permissions</h2>
<p class="help_p">If the server is launched with enough privileges,
it is possible to change its effective <b>user</b> and <b>group</b> to
prevent security issues. You can use either the user/group name or its
numerical ID.</p>

<p class="help_p">If a directory is specified as <b>chroot</b>, the
server will jail itself inside it. It is important to know that, even
if chroot is a security mechanism, it should not be used as the only
security measure.</p>
