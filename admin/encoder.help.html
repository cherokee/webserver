<h2>Encoders</h2>

<p class="help_p">The server encoders are the modules that transform
the information that the server, in one way or the other, generates
(reading the hard drive, relaying on a FastCGI application server,
executing a CGI, etc).</p>

<p class="help_p">The most important encoders are the
compressors. They deflate the information before it is sent to the
client, and therefore speed up the request response (there is less
information to be sent).</p>

<p class="help_p">At this time only the most widespread encoder is
supported: GZip.  We suggest to use it only with text based files;
trying to encode images or archives will only increase CPU load for
nothing.</p>
